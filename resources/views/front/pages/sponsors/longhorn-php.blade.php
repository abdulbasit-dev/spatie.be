                        Next to our paid products, we also create a lot of open source. Our team likes to use Laravel for most of our projects and we love to contribute to its awesome ecosystem. That's also why we have been creating Laravel and PHP packages since 2015. Our packages have been downloaded over 250 million times right now. Have a look at our <a href="https://spatie.be/open-source?search=&sort=-downloads">full list of packages</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of our packages are postcardware: free to use if you send us a postcard! All postcards end up on our <a href="https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards">digital postcard wall</a>. Pro tip: an easy way to send us a postcard is via <a href="https://spatie.cards">spatie.cards</a>.

                        By the way, we are currently working on a new course on how to write readable and testable PHP code. The course will take a deep look at how your code can be written as readable as possible. You can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/spatie_be">Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://writing-readable-php.com">our mailing list</a> to stay up to date!

                        We wrote <a href="https://front-line-php.com/">Front Line PHP</a>, a cutting edge course on building modern applications with PHP 8.1. We also created a <a href="https://spatie.be/videos/front-line-php">free video series</a> for Front Line PHP. These videos will guide you through all the new features of modern PHP.
